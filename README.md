## Load & Preprocess Data

The Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus is a rich dataset of movie character dialog:

    220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters

    9,035 characters from 617 movies

    304,713 total utterances

This dataset is large and diverse, and there is a great variation of language formality, time periods, sentiment, etc. Our hope is that this diversity makes our model robust to many forms of inputs and queries.
