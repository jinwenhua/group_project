    "# We will use a couple of clever tricks to aid in convergence:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# -  The first trick is using **teacher forcing**. This means that at some\n",
    "#    probability, set by ``teacher_forcing_ratio``, we use the current\n",
    "#    target word as the decoder’s next input rather than using the\n",
    "#    decoder’s current guess. This technique acts as training wheels for\n",
    "#    the decoder, aiding in more efficient training. However, teacher\n",
    "#    forcing can lead to model instability during inference, as the\n",
    "#    decoder may not have a sufficient chance to truly craft its own\n",
    "#    output sequences during training. Thus, we must be mindful of how we\n",
    "#    are setting the ``teacher_forcing_ratio``, and not be fooled by fast\n",
    "#    convergence.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# -  The second trick that we implement is **gradient clipping**. This is\n",
    "#    a commonly used technique for countering the “exploding gradient”\n",
    "#    problem. In essence, by clipping or thresholding gradients to a\n",
    "#    maximum value, we prevent the gradients from growing exponentially\n",
