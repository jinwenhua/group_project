    "By using two separate recurrent neural nets together, we can accomplish this task. One RNN acts as an encoder, which encodes a variable length input sequence to a fixed length context vector. In theory, this context vector(the final hidden layer of the RNN) will contain semantic information about the query sentence that is input word and the context vector, and returns a guess for the next word and the context vector, and returns a guess for the next word in the sequence and a hidden state to use in the next iteration.\n",

Using a bidirectional GRU will give us the advantage of encoding both past and future contexts.\n",

It continues genrating words until it outputs an *EOS_token*, representing the end of the sentence. A common problem with a vanilla seq2seq decoder is that if we rely solely on the context vector to encode the entire input sequence's meaning, it is likely that we will have information loss. This is especially the case when dealing with long input sequences, greatly limiting the capability of our decoder.\n",
